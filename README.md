# Fling
An (upcoming) all-in-one management system for Plex. Requests, Fetching, and
Organizing.

The main goal of Fling is to centralize all other attempts at automating Plex
(and other multimedia services). While the work done by Sonarr, Radarr, Ombi,
and more have been instrumental in making my life easier, I would rather see it
all put under a single roof with a consistent interface, users, and extensible
API. I would also like it to be a proper cross-platform service, and avoid the
use of Mono or other janky shims.
